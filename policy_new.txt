*   In accordance with the Nepal Rastra Bank Act, 2058, this bank has been publishing monetary policy since the fiscal year 2059/60 with the primary objective of maintaining price and balance of payments stability for sustainable economic development.
*   This is the twenty-fourth monetary policy for the fiscal year 2082/83 in this series.
*   The monetary policy for the fiscal year 2082/83 includes a review of the previous fiscal year's monetary policy, analysis of the economic and financial situation and outlook, policy arrangements, and major programs.
*   Additionally, policies and programs related to foreign exchange management, financial sector reform and regulation, payment system, microfinance, financial access and consumer protection, and anti-money laundering are also included in this monetary policy.
*   Although global economic growth has shown gradual improvement, uncertainty has increased recently due to geopolitical tensions and restrictive trade policies in some countries.
*   However, the International Monetary Fund's analysis suggests that global inflation is gradually improving and approaching pre-COVID levels.
*   Central banks in most countries with low economic growth and inflation have started adopting a flexible monetary policy to support economic expansion.
*   The economy is gradually returning to rhythm.
*   Inflation is within the desired limit.
*   Foreign exchange reserves have increased due to increased remittance inflows, foreign tourist arrivals, and exports.
*   Economic sectors that have been stagnant for the past two years have also started to expand, and the economic growth rate has improved compared to the previous year.
*   In the banking sector, due to ample liquidity, weighted average interest rates on deposits and loans are decreasing.
*   The average interest rate on deposits is higher than the average inflation rate.
*   The economy is currently in a position to benefit from increased liquidity and falling interest rates.
*   Stability has been maintained in the financial sector.
*   However, the non-performing loan ratio of banks and financial institutions, along with the increasing number of non-banking assets and blacklisted individuals, necessitates caution.
*   To enhance the quality of financial services for citizens, encourage capital formation through resources, and build a healthy and robust financial system, policy, structural, and operational reforms are required.
*   This necessitates policy formulation based on facts and dialogues, prudent regulation in line with international best practices, effective supervision, and consumer-friendly banking.
*   Furthermore, it is necessary to focus on the development of the system.
*   Additionally, it is necessary to gradually specialize the services provided by banks and financial institutions and review their classification and scope of work.
*   Based on the above background, the current monetary policy has been formulated considering the international/national economic and financial situation and outlook, and the bank's fourth strategic plan.
*   Emphasis has also been placed on the Nepal Government's budget for fiscal year 2082/83 and the sixteenth plan.
*   Additionally, the recommendations from the High-Level Economic Reform Suggestion Commission formed by the Nepal Government, the Monetary Policy Suggestion Committee, the Banking Sector Reform Taskforce, and suggestions received from stakeholders have also been considered in formulating the monetary policy for fiscal year 2082/83.
*   For the fiscal year 2081/82, the target was to keep inflation within 5.0 percent, whereas the average consumer price inflation until May 2082 is 4.24 percent.
*   The year-on-year point inflation in May 2082 is 2.72 percent.
*   The monetary policy for the fiscal year 2081/82 aimed to maintain foreign exchange reserves sufficient to cover at least seven months of imports of goods and services, and as of May 2082, the reserves are sufficient to cover 14.7 months of goods and services imports.
*   The monetary policy for the fiscal year 2081/82 had set the upper limit of the interest rate corridor at 6.5 percent for the Standing Liquidity Facility interest rate, the lower limit at 3.0 percent for the Standing Deposit Facility interest rate, and the policy rate at 5.0 percent, with the operating target of maintaining the weighted average interbank rate around the policy rate.
*   As of May 2082, the weighted average interbank rate is 3.0 percent.
*   According to the monetary policy arrangements, an automatic and rule-based open market operation has been conducted for liquidity management.
*   Until the eleventh month of fiscal year 2081/82, Rs. 27 Kharba 84 Arba 80 Crore in liquidity was absorbed through 81 instances of deposit auctions and Rs. 185 Kharba 58 Arba 70 Crore through 135 instances of Standing Deposit Facility.
*   After deducting the Rs. 2 Arba 70 Crore utilized by banks and financial institutions through the overnight liquidity facility during this period.
*   A net liquidity of Rs. 213 Kharba 40 Arba 80 Crore has been absorbed.
*   In the previous fiscal year, a net liquidity of Rs. 38 Kharba 68 Arba 84 Crore was absorbed through various open market instruments.
*   Until the eleventh month of fiscal year 2081/82, liquidity of Rs. 673 Arba 25 Crore has been injected through net purchase of US Dollars from the foreign exchange market.
*   In the previous fiscal year, Rs. 783 Arba 47 Crore was injected through such transactions.
*   During this period, short-term interest rates have remained similar to the Standing Deposit Facility rate.
*   The weighted average interbank rate of banks and financial institutions averaged 2.99 percent until May 2082, compared to 3.62 percent in the previous fiscal year.
*   Similarly, the weighted average interest rate of 91-day Treasury Bills averaged 2.94 percent in May 2082, compared to 3.00 percent in Ashar 2081.
*   Due to low short-term interest rates of banks and financial institutions, deposit and loan interest rates have also been decreasing.
*   In Ashar 2081, the weighted average deposit interest rate of commercial banks was 6.17 percent, development banks 7.07 percent, and finance companies 8.28 percent, while in May 2082, these average interest rates were 4.29 percent, 5.02 percent, and 6.09 percent, respectively.
*   Similarly, in Ashar 2081, the weighted average loan interest rate of commercial banks was 10.15 percent, development banks 11.63 percent, and finance companies 12.85 percent, while in May 2082, these average interest rates were 7.99 percent, 9.40 percent, and 10.22 percent, respectively.
*   As of Baishakh 2082, out of the total loans invested by commercial banks, 13.9 percent (Rs. 647 Arba 85 Crore) was in the agricultural sector, 9.0 percent (Rs. 418 Arba 74 Crore) in the energy sector, and 10.8 percent (Rs. 503 Arba 39 Crore) in the micro, small, and medium enterprise sector.
*   Similarly, development banks had invested 26.4 percent (Rs. 132 Arba 88 Crore) of their total loans in agriculture, micro, small, and medium enterprises/businesses, energy, and tourism sectors, while finance companies had invested 18.8 percent (Rs. 19 Arba 6 Crore) of their loans.
*   As of Chaitra 2081, 5.6 percent (Rs. 262 Arba 22 Crore) of the total loans disbursed by commercial banks were extended to the deprived class.
*   Similarly, development banks extended 7.1 percent (Rs. 36 Arba 17 Crore) and finance companies extended 5.5 percent (Rs. 5 Arba 60 Crore) to the deprived class.
*   Under the concessional loan program with interest subsidies from the Nepal Government, as of May 2082, a total of Rs. 85 Arba 10 Crore was outstanding, disbursed to 98,528 borrowers.
*   For banks and financial institutions, the loan loss provisioning requirement for good loans has been gradually reduced from 1.2 percent to 1.0 percent.
*   Similarly, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer requirement, part of the Capital Adequacy Framework, is zero percent for the fiscal year 2081/82 for banks and financial institutions.
*   Facilities have been provided to restructure and reschedule loans disbursed to sectors including construction until Ashar 2082.
*   The risk weight for margin-type loans has been reduced from 125 percent to 100 percent.
*   The provision that loans classified as non-performing by banks and financial institutions can only be reclassified as good after 6 months has been amended; now, they can be reclassified as good after being classified as 'micro-monitored' for 6 months.
*   In relation to anti-money laundering, the Guideline on Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions has been implemented for reporting institutions to follow their obligations.
*   The maximum limit for loans that can be calculated under the Regulatory Retail Portfolio for capital calculation purposes has been increased from Rs. 2 Crore to Rs. 2 Crore 50 Lakh.
*   Nepal Green Finance Taxonomy has been issued to encourage banks and financial institutions to promote loans and investments in environment-friendly sectors.
*   The limit for foreign currency exchange facility for spending from convertible foreign currency accounts has been increased.
*   Provisions have been made to facilitate foreign currency exchange for goods and services imports by determining annual and sectoral limits.
*   Through the fourth amendment to the Nepal Rastra Bank, Foreign Investment and Loan Management Bylaws, 2078, provisions related to foreign investment and loans have been further simplified.
*   To use instruments for foreign exchange risk mitigation, the Nepal Rastra Bank Swap Transaction Bylaws, 2081 have been issued.
*   The maximum limit for Non-Deliverable Forwards used by banks and financial institutions to mitigate foreign exchange risk on foreign investments has been increased from 15 percent of primary capital to 20 percent.
*   The limit for importing goods through Document Against Payment and Document Against Acceptance has been increased from USD 60,000 to USD 100,000.

*   A complete description of the implementation status of policy arrangements made in the Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2081/82 and its quarterly reviews is provided in Annex 2.
*   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) analysis indicates that the global economy, after gradually improving following the COVID-19 pandemic, has again been affected by increasing geopolitical tensions and restrictive trade policies among major economies.
*   As a result, global economic growth is projected to expand by 3.3 percent in 2024 and only 2.8 percent in 2025.
*   Developed economies are projected to expand by 1.8 percent in 2024 and 1.4 percent in 2025, while emerging and developing economies are projected to expand by 4.3 percent in 2024 and 3.7 percent in 2025.
*   The economies of India and China are projected to expand by 6.5 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively, in 2024.
*   In 2025, the IMF projects respective expansions of 6.2 percent and 4.0 percent for these economies.
*   Global inflation has been decreasing for the past three years.
*   The IMF projects global consumer inflation to be 5.7 percent in 2024 and 4.3 percent in 2025.
*   Inflation in developed economies is projected to be 2.6 percent in 2024 and limited to 2.5 percent in 2025.
*   Similarly, inflation in emerging and developing economies is projected to be 7.7 percent in 2024 and limited to 5.5 percent in 2025.
*   Although global inflation is on a downward trend, geopolitical tensions and restrictive trade policies in some countries continue to pose a risk of price pressures, according to the IMF’s analysis.
*   As inflation decreases, central banks in most countries have started adopting a flexible monetary policy.
*   The European Central Bank (ECB) has cut the deposit facility rate eight times since June 2024.
*   Similarly, the Reserve Bank of India has reduced its policy rate to 5.5 percent in June 2025, from 6.5 percent since February 2023.
*   The People's Bank of China reduced its one-year loan prime rate to 3.00 percent in June 2025, from 3.55 percent in June 2023.
*   The US Federal Reserve has reduced the federal funds rate three times to a range of 4.25-4.50 percent in December 2024, from a range of 5.25-5.5 percent in September 2024.
*   The National Statistics Office estimates economic growth to be 4.61 percent in the fiscal year 2081/82.
*   In the previous fiscal year, economic growth was 3.67 percent.
*   In fiscal year 2081/82, the agriculture sector is estimated to grow by 3.28 percent, the industry sector by 4.53 percent, and the services sector by 4.21 percent.
*   While the manufacturing, construction, and wholesale and retail trade sub-sectors experienced contraction in the previous two fiscal years, all these sub-sectors are estimated to expand in fiscal year 2081/82.
*   The latest estimate from the National Statistics Office indicates economic growth of 4.8 percent in the third quarter of fiscal year 2081/82.
*   This year, due to timely monsoon, agricultural production, including paddy, is expected to have a positive impact.
*   Furthermore, the government's initiatives to provide subsidies on improved seeds, ensure easy availability of chemical fertilizers, and set minimum support prices before cultivation of paddy, maize, wheat, sugarcane, and coffee are expected to lead to satisfactory growth in the agricultural sector.
*   Among the under-construction national pride and highly prioritized infrastructure projects, Nagdhunga Tunnel Road, Kathmandu-Terai Fast Track, Prithvi Highway's Pokhara-Muglin Road Section, Bheri-Babai Multipurpose Project, Siddhababa Tunnel Road, etc., are in their completion phase.
*   It is expected that these projects, once completed, will contribute to the expansion of industrial and service sectors and economic activities.
*   Similarly, construction work is advancing to add at least one thousand megawatts of hydropower capacity annually for the next five years.
*   Electricity export to Bangladesh has started from Ashar 1, 2082 after a power purchase agreement.
*   Tourist arrivals have reached pre-COVID-19 levels, and tourism infrastructure has expanded.
*   With Pokhara and Lumbini International Airports operating at full capacity, there is potential for increased production and employment in internal and external tourism and related economic sectors.
*   The Nepal Government's budget for fiscal year 2082/83 includes policy facilitation for IT service exports, and programs to promote small and medium enterprises, which are expected to expand service exports.
*   In fiscal year 2082/83, the Nepal Government aims to achieve economic growth of 6.0 percent.
*   With the increased allocation for capital expenditure in the budgets of all three levels of government compared to the previous year, sufficient liquidity in the financial system with low interest rates for investment, and an improved investment environment due to reforms in investment-related laws, it appears that the target economic growth can be achieved through development and expansion in agriculture, services, and infrastructure sectors.
*   In the eleven months of fiscal year 2081/82, the average consumer price inflation was 4.24 percent.
*   In fiscal year 2080/81, the annual average consumer price inflation was 5.44 percent.
*   In May 2082, inflation for the food and beverage group was 0.54 percent, and for the non-food and services group, it was 3.94 percent, with the annual point inflation recorded at 2.72 percent.
*   During this period, significant improvement in inflation has been observed due to increased internal agricultural production, decreased wholesale and consumer inflation in India, improved crude oil prices in the international market, and easier internal transportation.
*   In recent months, inflationary pressures have eased, timely monsoon is expected to lead to positive food production, and India's inflation, which directly impacts Nepal's inflation, is projected to decrease to 3.7 percent in the coming year, therefore, inflation for fiscal year 2082/83 is projected to remain around 5.0 percent.
*   In recent times, foreign trade has started gaining momentum.
*   In the first eleven months of fiscal year 2081/82, total goods exports increased by 77.8 percent to Rs. 247 Arba 57 Crore, while total goods imports increased by 13.1 percent to Rs. 16 Kharba 44 Arba 80 Crore.
*   During this period, the trade deficit increased by 6.3 percent to Rs. 13 Kharba 97 Arba 23 Crore.
*   While the growth rate of exports is high, the base is small, and as imports begin to normalize, the trade deficit is expected to widen somewhat in the coming year.
*   In the first eleven months of fiscal year 2081/82, remittance inflows increased by 15.5 percent in Nepali Rupees and 12.7 percent in US Dollars.
*   During this period, the number of Nepalese going for foreign employment (new and renewed) increased by 11.4 percent to 760,391 compared to the same period in the previous year.
*   Remittance growth is expected to remain satisfactory in fiscal year 2082/83 if external conditions remain favorable.
*   In the first eleven months of fiscal year 2081/82, the balance of payments (BOP) recorded a surplus of Rs. 491 Arba 44 Crore, and the current account recorded a surplus of Rs. 307 Arba 31 Crore.
*   Due to the high growth of remittance inflows compared to imports, significant surpluses have been maintained in the BOP and current account.
*   The current account and BOP are estimated to remain in surplus in fiscal year 2082/83 as well.
*   In the first eleven months of fiscal year 2081/82, total foreign exchange reserves increased by 25.9 percent to Rs. 25 Kharba 69 Arba 38 Crore as of May 2082.
*   In US Dollars, these reserves increased by 22.2 percent to USD 18 billion 65 Crore.
*   During this period, the foreign exchange reserves were sufficient to cover approximately 14.7 months of goods and services imports.
*   The current account and BOP are expected to remain favorable in the coming fiscal year, and foreign exchange reserves are estimated to remain adequate.
*   According to the Financial Comptroller General Office, Nepal Government, total expenditures of the federal government increased by 8.6 percent in the first eleven months of fiscal year 2081/82.
*   Of this, recurrent expenditure accounted for 66.4 percent and capital expenditure 11.2 percent of the total expenditure.
*   Similarly, during this period, Nepal Government's revenue mobilization increased by 10.5 percent.
*   Of this, tax revenue increased by 10.7 percent and non-tax revenue by 8.8 percent.
*   Tax revenue constituted 90.3 percent of the total revenue.
*   According to the Public Debt Management Office, Nepal Government, in the first eleven months of fiscal year 2081/82, internal debt of Rs. 314 Arba 99 Crore and external debt of Rs. 99 Arba 20 Crore were mobilized, totaling Rs. 414 Arba 19 Crore.
*   During this period, debt payments totaling Rs. 266 Arba 66 Crore, combining internal and external debt, were made.
*   The Nepal Government has presented a budget of Rs. 19 Kharba 64 Arba for the fiscal year 2082/83.
*   Of this, capital expenditure is Rs. 407 Arba 89 Crore.
*   Among the sources to cover the expenditure in the budget, Rs. 13 Kharba 15 Arba from revenue mobilization and Rs. 53 Arba 45 Crore from foreign grants are expected to cover Rs. 5 Kharba 96 Arba, indicating a deficit.
*   This budget deficit is estimated to be covered by mobilizing internal debt of Rs. 362 Arba and external debt of Rs. 233 Arba 66 Crore.
*   In the first eleven months of fiscal year 2081/82, broad money (M2) grew by 8.2 percent.
*   In the same period of the previous year, broad money grew by 9.1 percent.
*   Compared to the previous year, despite a significant increase in net foreign assets in the first eleven months of fiscal year 2081/82, the expansion of broad money was lower due to less expansion in net domestic assets.
*   In the first eleven months of fiscal year 2081/82, banks and financial institutions disbursed Rs. 407 Arba 62 Crore in loans to the private sector.
*   On a year-on-year basis, private sector credit grew by 8.7 percent as of May 2082.
*   In the same period of the previous year, such credit grew by 5.6 percent.
*   On a year-on-year basis, deposit mobilization grew by 12.0 percent as of May 2082.
*   In the same period of the previous year, such deposits grew by 12.6 percent.
*   Due to ample liquidity in banks and financial institutions, deposit and loan interest rates have been decreasing.
*   In Ashar 2081, the average base rate of commercial banks was 8.17 percent, which has now fallen to 6.09 percent in May 2082.
*   Similarly, in Ashar 2081, the weighted average deposit interest rate of commercial banks was 6.17 percent, and the weighted average loan interest rate was 10.15 percent, while during this period, these rates have decreased to 4.29 percent and 7.99 percent, respectively.
*   The economic slowdown observed in the past two years has also affected loan recovery by banks and financial institutions, with the non-performing loan ratio reaching 5.24 percent in Chaitra 2081.
*   In the same period of the previous year, this ratio was 3.98 percent.
*   However, the minimum capital adequacy ratio and liquid assets maintained by banks and financial institutions remain within regulatory limits.
*   Against the backdrop of ample liquidity in the financial system and decreasing loan interest rates, aggregate demand has been improving.
*   In fiscal year 2081/82, inflation was projected to remain around 5.0 percent, whereas the average inflation for the first eleven months was 4.24 percent.
*   It was recorded.
*   It is 2.72 percent in May 2082, showing a decreasing trend for the past six months.
*   Similarly, the monetary policy aimed to maintain foreign exchange reserves sufficient to cover at least seven months of goods and services imports, while the reserves as of May 2082 are sufficient to cover 14.7 months of goods and services imports.
*   This bank has been making policy rate decisions based on the projected and expected inflation gap and foreign exchange reserves.
*   In the current favorable environment, it seems necessary to adopt a somewhat flexible monetary policy direction to enhance aggregate demand.
*   Additionally, attention has been paid to preventing negative real interest rates on deposits.
*   After the COVID pandemic, the share of gross fixed capital formation in gross domestic product has decreased, and within gross fixed capital, the share of private sector capital formation has also decreased.
*   Despite low financial intermediation costs and loan interest rates, capital formation has not improved as expected, thus, attention should be paid to mobilizing financial resources towards sectors that have strong forward-backward linkages in the economy, and contribute directly to production and capital formation.
*   The non-traditional monetary measures and policy easing adopted after the COVID-19 pandemic had put pressure on inflation and foreign exchange reserves.
*   With the easing of pressure on these economic variables in the past two years, monetary measures and regulatory arrangements have been made more flexible.
*   However, since loan growth has not increased as expected despite ample liquidity and low interest rates, it is necessary to focus on economic and monetary reforms, including prudent regulation, in alignment with regulatory arrangements.
*   The implementation of the interest rate corridor framework has helped in monitoring the operating target of monetary policy and improving policy transparency and accountability.
*   To further strengthen monetary transmission based on interest rates, it is necessary to narrow the gap between the upper and lower limits of the corridor by following international best practices in the implementation of the interest rate corridor.
*   Similarly, by improving liquidity provision and absorption arrangements to make open market operations effective, attention should be paid to policy improvements related to interest rates to maintain short-term interest rates within the corridor limits.
*   While inflation is currently low and foreign exchange reserves are in a comfortable position, it is necessary to pay attention to the risks arising from geopolitical tensions, trade frictions, and volatility in crude oil prices, which appear from time to time in the global economy.
*   Therefore, continuous monitoring of major economic and financial indicators such as inflation, trade deficit, remittance inflows, and balance of payments is necessary, and monetary management should focus on preventing price and external sector pressures from loan expansion.
*   Based on comfortable inflation, favorable foreign exchange reserve situation, and the outlook, the monetary policy direction has been made cautiously flexible to dynamize the economy.
*   This is expected to reduce the cost of capital formation for the private sector and government internal debt mobilization, thereby facilitating economic activity growth.
*   In line with the maintenance of financial stability, the monetary policy measures and prudent regulatory arrangements have been harmonized to increase loan access and quality, and to reduce loan concentration.
*   Open market operations and the interest rate corridor have been further strengthened to make the monetary transmission mechanism more effective.
*   For the fiscal year 2082/83, inflation is targeted to remain around 5.0 percent, and foreign exchange reserves sufficient to cover at least seven months of goods and services imports, in line with the Nepal Government's budget statement, to achieve an economic growth rate of 6.0 percent, by managing monetary liquidity and foreign exchange.
*   For the fiscal year 2082/83, broad money growth is projected to be 13.0 percent, and private sector credit growth is projected to be up to 12.0 percent.
*   The fixed exchange rate of Nepali Rupees with Indian Rupees, which has been considered an anchor for monetary policy, is maintained as an interim target.
*   The weighted average interbank rate of banks and financial institutions is maintained as the operating target of monetary policy, and automatic and rule-based open market operations are continued.
*   Open market operations will be conducted to maintain the weighted average interbank rate of banks and financial institutions close to the policy rate.
*   The bank rate, which is the upper limit of the interest rate corridor, has been reduced from 6.5 percent to 6.0 percent, and the deposit collection rate, which is the lower limit of the interest rate corridor, has been reduced from 3.0 percent to 2.75 percent.
*   The policy rate has been set at 4.5 percent, reduced from 5.0 percent.
*   The existing arrangement for providing Standing Liquidity Facility at the bank rate has been continued.
*   The existing arrangements regarding the Mandatory Cash Reserve Ratio and Statutory Liquidity Ratio have been continued.
*   To effectively manage the structural liquidity in the banking system, Nepal Rastra Bank will issue debt securities as needed.
*   Systemic improvements will be made to allow this bank to directly monitor interbank transactions conducted between banks and financial institutions in real-time, making them more organized and transparent.
*   Although the economy is gradually recovering, non-performing loans (NPLs) and non-banking assets of banks and financial institutions have increased.
*   This has put pressure on capital funds and affected loan disbursement capacity.
*   The number of borrowers being blacklisted is also increasing.
*   Therefore, increasing the loan disbursement capacity of banks and financial institutions, facilitating loan management, and strengthening capital funds to maintain financial stability are priorities.
*   Additionally, attention needs to be paid to managing NPLs and non-banking assets by prioritizing the establishment of asset management companies.
*   The banking system has ample liquidity and low interest rates, which can benefit the economy.
*   For this, it is essential for banks and financial institutions, while extending loans, to give high priority to self-regulation, analyzing the borrower's project, knowledge, skills, and capacity.
*   For financial stability, while implementing regulation based on international standards, it is necessary to gradually ease additional regulations and prioritize risk-based monitoring/supervision, making banks and financial institutions more responsible in their loan decisions.
*   With rapid technological development and utilization, the financial system has entered a new phase.
*   It is necessary to adopt modern technology and utilize new skills, capabilities, and opportunities in the financial sector.
*   For this, it is necessary to encourage banks and financial institutions to provide specialized services by diversifying institutions, making financial instruments accessible and competitive.
*   Policy arrangements related to prudent regulation and supervision, foreign exchange management, payment system, and anti-money laundering have been made to align with the monetary policy direction for fiscal year 2082/83.
