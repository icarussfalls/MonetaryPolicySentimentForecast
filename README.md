A machine learning system that predicts stock sector returns based on monetary policy reports using FinBERT embeddings and neural networks.

## 🎯 Overview

This project analyzes monetary policy documents (PDFs/text) and predicts 30-day returns for various stock market sectors. The system uses advanced NLP techniques with financial domain-specific models to extract actionable investment insights from policy communications.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📄 Document Processing**: Extract text from PDF monetary policy reports
- **🧠 FinBERT Integration**: Leverage financial domain-specific BERT embeddings
- **🎯 Sector Prediction**: Predict returns for 13+ stock market sectors
- **📊 Cross-Validation**: Robust 5-fold cross-validation training
- **🔍 Explainable AI**: SHAP-based sentence-level influence analysis
- **📈 Performance Metrics**: R², directional accuracy, and sector-specific analytics

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Monetary Policy Report → FinBERT Embeddings → Neural Network → Sector Returns
                      ↓
            Sentence-level Analysis → Influential Sentences → Investment Insights
```

## 📊 Performance

- **R² Score**: 0.11 (explains 11% of return variance)
- **Directional Accuracy**: 63.16% (beats random 50% baseline)
- **Sectors Covered**: 13+ including Banking, Finance, Trading, Hotels, etc.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install torch transformers pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib shap pdfplumber nltk
```

### 1. Data Preparation

```bash
# Extract text from PDF reports
python extract_text.py

# This creates report_embeddings.npy with FinBERT embeddings
```

### 2. Model Training

```bash
# Train the model with cross-validation
python train.py

# Outputs:
# - policy_return_model.pt (best model)
# - sector_mapping.npy (sector mappings)
# - cross_validation_results.png (training curves)
```

### 3. Make Predictions

```bash
# Predict from new monetary policy text
python predict.py --text new_policy_report.txt

# Predict with detailed analysis
python predict.py --text new_policy_report.txt --analyze

# Outputs:
# - predictions.csv (sector predictions)
# - influential_sentences.csv (explainable AI results)
# - sector visualizations (PNG files)
```

## 🔧 Model Architecture

### FinBERTRegressor
```python
class FinBERTRegressor(nn.Module):
    - Input: 768D FinBERT embeddings + sector embeddings
    - Hidden: 256D fully connected layers
    - Output: Single return prediction
    - Regularization: Dropout, weight decay
```

### Training Configuration
- **Optimizer**: AdamW (lr=5e-5, weight_decay=0.001)
- **Loss Function**: Huber Loss (robust to outliers)
- **Batch Size**: 8 (adaptive based on data)
- **Epochs**: 10 per fold
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold stratified

## 📈 Sample Output

### Predictions (predictions.csv)
```csv
Sector,Predicted_Return
FINANCE,0.0594
MANUFACTURE,0.0520
HOTELS,0.0464
OTHERS,0.0438
TRADING,0.0432
...
MICROFINANCE,-0.0146
```

### Influential Sentences (influential_sentences.csv)
```csv
Sector,Sentence,Impact,Direction
BANKING,"Interest rates will remain stable...",0.023,Positive
TRADING,"Market volatility concerns...",-0.018,Negative
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

1. **Investment Strategy**: Identify sectors likely to outperform
2. **Risk Management**: Spot sectors facing policy headwinds
3. **Policy Analysis**: Understand market impact of policy decisions
4. **Research**: Quantify text-to-market relationships

## 📊 Sector Coverage

| Sector | Code | Typical Performance |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| Banking | BANKING | Strong policy sensitivity |
| Finance | FINANCE | High prediction accuracy |
| Trading | TRADING | Moderate volatility |
| Hotels | HOTELS | Tourism policy dependent |
| Manufacturing | MANUFACTURE | Export policy sensitive |
| Hydropower | HYDROPOWER | Infrastructure dependent |
| Insurance | LIFEINSU/NONLIFEINSU | Regulatory sensitive |
| Microfinance | MICROFINANCE | Policy vulnerable |

## 🔬 Advanced Features

### Explainable AI Analysis
```bash
python predict.py --text report.txt --analyze
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Key Parameters (model.py)
```python
EMBEDDING_DIM = 768        # FinBERT output size
SECTOR_EMBED_DIM = 32      # Sector embedding size
HIDDEN_DIM = 256           # Neural network width
DROPOUT_RATE = 0.1         # Regularization strength
```

### Training Parameters (train.py)
